# Personal cash flow

This is a tool, which
- readâ€™s always your latest bank statement
- filters your bank statements by usual and recurrent transactions
- and subtract savings-related transactions from your expenses by predefined categories, in order to rate your consumption related to your income.

In the next step it adds further bank balances, stock and etf values and monthly growth rates, to build your assets overview. Then it gives you a recommendation on how to improve your annual returns based on your latest market shares.

Finally some predictions are made of how good the machine categorizes transactions by train and test split, and there is also a base with time series analysis to predict your future money stream, based on your past balance.
